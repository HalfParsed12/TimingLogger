# Timing Logger

This is a personal project of mine, written in C# using Visual Studio. The aim is to provide data to help players of Project Cars improve their driving by becoming more consistent.
It gets timing data from pCARS' shared memory, which the CREST API outputs in json format. Timing Logger periodically checks this data to get up-to-date timing information.
